# My thoughts and rambles

Pop a Dots is a simple arcade game where you tap to pop all of the circles on the screen while evading the evil black dots that get progessively harder as the game progresses.

This was a rewrite of an Objective-C version combined with porting features and logic from a Python version (using PyGame), a C++ iOS version (using SDL2), and two separate C++ versions for desktop (one OpenGL and the other SDL2). I was also trying to catch up to the Android version (written in Java, targeting API 21?).

First off, holy crap - don't develop the initial version of your app targeting an iOS beta - there were so many bugs and breaking API changes from Apple.

I honestly think I wrote some pretty decent code, even though my experience with Swift and iOS development were very amatuer. Hopefully with newer (and more cross-platform!) API's and languages, mobile development can be easier.
